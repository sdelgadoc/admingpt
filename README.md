## üîß Installation

Follow these steps to setup AdminGPT on your system:

### 1. Clone the Repository
To clone the repository to your local machine, use the following command in your terminal:

`git clone https://github.com/sdelgadoc/AdminGPT.git`

This will create a local copy of the repository.

### 2. Install Required Dependencies
Install the necessary dependencies by running:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

This command installs all the packages listed in requirements.txt, ensuring the project runs correctly.

### 3. Generate an OpenAI API key
Follow the instructions as per the [OpenAI API Quickstart](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart?context=python)

### 4. Generate your Microsoft Graph credentials
To use this toolkit, you need to set up your credentials explained in the [Microsoft Graph authentication and authorization overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/). Once you've received a CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET, you can input them as environmental variables below. You can also use the authentication instructions from the [O365 Python library documentation](https://o365.github.io/python-o365/latest/getting_started.html#oauth-setup-pre-requisite).

## üß™ Testing

Test AdminGPT by summarizing a recent email from a particular sender, the most simple functionality.

### Run the AdminGPT command line interface (CLI)
1. Set the folling authentication environmental variables:
   - OPENAI_API_KEY: The OpenAI API key for authentication
   - CLIENT_ID: The Microsoft Graph client ID for authentication
   - CLIENT_SECRET: The Microsoft Graph client secret for authentication

2. Run the CLI using:

   `python admingtp_cli.py`

   If the assistant is running correctly, you should see the following on the command line

   `Hello, [YOUR NAME]. How can I help you?`

   `Enter your request here:`

## üèó Deploy Django Application Locally

To deploy the Django application locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Follow the Installation and Testing Steps Above
Make sure you have completed all installation steps and tested AdminGPT‚Äôs basic functionality.

### 2. Create an Environment Variable File
Create a file in the root directory called `.env` (note the leading dot) and include the following environment variables with your corresponding values:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=[Your OpenAI API Key]
CLIENT_ID=[Your Client ID]
CLIENT_SECRET=[Your Client Secret]
SECRET_KEY=[Your Django application's secret key]
```

### 3. Run the Django Migrations
Navigate to the project folder and run the migrations:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### 4. Start the Local Django Server
To run the local server using self-signed certificates (for HTTPS):

```bash
python manage.py runserver_plus --cert-file localhost.crt --key-file localhost.key
```

### 5. Authenticate and Generate an Authentication Token
In your browser, go to:

```
https://127.0.0.1:8000/authenticate/
```

> **Note**: Your browser may warn that your connection is not private because you are using self-generated certificates. You can safely proceed.

1. Make sure you are logged into your Microsoft account.  
2. Complete the Microsoft authentication workflow.  
3. If you are redirected to the [AdminGPT GitHub page](https://github.com/sdelgadoc/AdminGPT), the authentication flow has worked correctly.

### 6. Test the Functionality
Send yourself an email with the following content:

```
Subject: Test
Body: 
Hi Monica, can you write a limerick describing the theme of all the meetings I have this week?
```

Then, in your browser, visit:

```
https://127.0.0.1:8000/process-email/
```

If you receive an email from **Monica** performing the requested task, everything is working as expected!
